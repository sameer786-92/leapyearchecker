# leapyearchecker

Sure, let's dry run the provided program with an example scenario.

Initial variables:

continueloop is set to true.
Execution:

The program starts, and a Scanner object is created for input.
The while loop begins, and continueloop is true.
The program prints "Enter a year: ".
Let's assume the user enters 2024.
The program checks if year is equal to 0, which it's not.
The program checks if year is between 1000 and 9999, which it is.
Since 2024 is divisible by 4, the program prints "2024 is a leap year!".
The loop continues, and the program prints "Enter a year: ".
Let's assume the user enters 1999.
The program checks if year is equal to 0, which it's not.
The program checks if year is between 1000 and 9999, which it's not. It prints "Enter four digits!".
The loop continues, and the program prints "Enter a year: ".
Let's assume the user enters 0.
The program checks if year is equal to 0, which it is. It sets continueloop to false.
The program prints "Program Exited!!..." and closes the Scanner.
